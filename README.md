# SoftDev2-Project
CSE UOI Software Development II Project 

The goal of this project is to reengineer a Java application. At a glance, the application serves for the income tax
calculation of the Minnesota state citizens. The tax calculation accounts for the marital status of a given citizen,
his income, and the amount of money that he has spend, as witnessed by a set of receipts declared along with the
income. The legacy application takes as input txt or xml files that contain the necessary data for each citizen. The
tax calculation is based on a complex algorithm provided by the Minnesota state. The application further produces
graphical representations of the data in terms of bar and pie charts. Finally. the application produces respective
output reports in txt or xml.

Is Currently, a work in progress...
