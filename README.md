# IncomeTaxCalculator
IncomeTaxCalculator is a refactored Java application that calculates income tax for citizens of Minnesota state. This project was developed as part of the [Software Development II ](https://www.cse.uoi.gr/course/software-engineering-ii/?lang=en) course [@cse.uoi.gr](https://www.cs.uoi.gr/) during the fall semester of 2022.

## Summary

The objective of this project is to re-engineer a Java application that calculates income tax for citizens of Minnesota state. The tax calculation takes into account the citizen's marital status, income, and expenses, as evidenced by a set of receipts submitted with the income. The legacy application takes txt or xml files as input that contain the necessary data for each citizen. The tax calculation is based on a complex algorithm provided by the state. The application also generates graphical representations of the data in the form of bar and pie charts, and produces output reports in txt or xml format.

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this phase of the project are to simplify the design to make it more extensible and maintainable, and to redesign the graphical interface to enhance its user-friendliness.

- Analyzing the existing application to identify areas of complexity and redundancy
- Refactoring the application code to eliminate redundancy and simplify the design
- Implementing a new graphical interface that is more intuitive and user-friendly
- Testing the application to ensure it meets all functional requirements

## Use Cases

The following use cases describe the functionality of the IncomeTaxCalculator application:

- UC1: AddTaxpayer
- UC2: ViewTaxpayerInfo
- UC3: UpdateReceiptOfTaxpayer
- UC4: DeleteReceiptOfTaxpayer
- UC5: DisplayTaxCharts
- UC6: StoreTaxpayerLog
- UC7: RemoveTaxpayer
